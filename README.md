**End to End Data Engineering Project**

The objective of this project is to design and implement a scalable, cloud-based data engineering pipeline for an e-commerce platform using Azure services. The pipeline will enable efficient data ingestion, transformation, enrichment by integrating data sources (HTTP-GitHub and ADLSGen2), ensuring data quality, and providing actionable insights through advanced analytics and visualization tools.

**âœ… Key Goals:**
â€¢	Automate Data Ingestion: Seamlessly ingest data dynamically from diverse sources (HTTPS-GitHub) into ADLS Gen2 storage using Azure Data Factory with parameterization.
â€¢	Implement Medallion Architecture: Organize and transform data through bronze, silver, and gold layers to improve data quality and accessibility.
â€¢	Enable Data Transformation & Enrichment: Leverage Azure Databricks for data processing with pyspark for data enrichment.
â€¢	Optimize Analytics with Synapse: Use Azure Synapse Analytics for efficient querying, analytics, and reporting on large datasets.
â€¢	Ensure Production-Readiness: Apply best practices for performance optimization, error handling, monitoring, and maintenance.
